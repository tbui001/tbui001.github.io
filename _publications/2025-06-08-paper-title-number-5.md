With the increasing speed of advance of both Internet of Things (IoT) and the demands of utilizing IoT devices in different locations with high compatibility, fog computing has been foreseen as a sustainable solution. However, new challenges related to fog computing's cyber security also emerge. Among various cyber-attacks on the fog computing system, one standard method is to implement corrupted internal nodes that allow malicious/compromised access from attackers, threatening the confidentiality of users' information and the system's performance. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify the distribution of each attribute value from historical access logs from each node within a fog computing system. We also utilize an unsupervised machine learning method to separate nodes into smaller clusters with respect to different models to improve the forecasting ability of the system. Finally, our models are evaluated over simulated data using real access logs. Our experimental results illustrate that our proposed method achieves some advanced performance over applying an overall classification, even using the same classification machine learning methods and dataset.
