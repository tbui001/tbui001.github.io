My name is Thanh Bui. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Arkansas. My main research interests are Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and their applications. I am also a Natural Language Processing (NLP) enthusiast, a data tinkerer, and a puzzle solver (although I am not very good at these). When I am not building models, I enjoy nature. I love fishing and outdoor activities, such as biking, hiking, and anything that lets me stay outside.

I love reading fiction, especially fantasy, with rich, immersive world-building and historical romance novels. I also like to spend as much time as possible with my family when I can, as they are the best thing that has happened to my life.
